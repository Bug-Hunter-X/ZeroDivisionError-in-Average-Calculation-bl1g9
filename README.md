This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: the `ZeroDivisionError`. The `bug.py` file contains code that calculates the average of a list of numbers but does not handle the case of an empty input list. This results in a division by zero error.  The solution is shown in `bugSolution.py`.  This simple example illustrates the importance of proper error handling in Python.
